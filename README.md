# DentalCaries-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

TeethCaries Classification ü¶∑‚ú®
TeethCaries Classification is a machine learning project designed to assist in the early diagnosis of dental caries (tooth decay) using advanced image classification techniques. By leveraging the power of deep learning, this project aims to help healthcare professionals identify dental caries efficiently and accurately.

üìã Project Overview
Dental caries is one of the most common oral health problems. Accurate and early detection can significantly reduce the cost and complexity of treatment. This project utilizes machine learning and deep learning models to classify teeth images as either caries-affected or healthy, based on visual patterns.

üöÄ Features
Image Preprocessing: Ensures high-quality input by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting images for better model performance.
Deep Learning Model: Implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for robust and precise classification.
Data Visualization: Includes plots for training/validation accuracy, loss metrics, and more.
Real-time Prediction: Accepts new images for real-time classification.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python (3.8+)
Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras (for building CNN models)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
Pandas (for data handling)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations)
Jupyter Notebook: For step-by-step code execution and visualization.
Dataset: High-quality dental images labeled as healthy or caries-affected.
üìÇ Folder Structure
Dataset: Contains the input images used for training and testing.
Notebook: The main notebook file TeethCaries_Classification.ipynb with code, explanations, and outputs.
Models: Trained models saved for reuse and real-time predictions.
Results: Visualizations and evaluation metrics showcasing model performance.
üß© How It Works
Data Preparation: The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets.
Model Training: A CNN architecture is trained on the data to learn the distinguishing features of dental caries.
Evaluation: Model performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: The trained model is used to classify new dental images.
‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project is a proof of concept (POC) and is not intended for real-world clinical diagnosis. Always consult dental professionals for accurate diagnoses and treatments.

üéØ Future Enhancements
Add more complex models, such as transfer learning with pretrained networks (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).
Expand the dataset with diverse and high-resolution dental images.
Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit for easy access.
